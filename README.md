This is my own resource monitor app that I'm building to be deployed in a container or to be run in a cluster. I will be adding and testing new features over the next month. These will include-
- Normal container resource usage like cpu, ram, disk, network.

- This will also have logging of errors or alerts that you can set within a range of parameters.

- The error and alert logs will be stored to their own folders.

- There will be a charts available to plot error's or alerts over time to see trends that might be hidden.

- I also want to add the ability for the monitor to be able to monitor clusters like in kubernetes or docker swarm.

- Last there will be deeper metrics to look at that can help troubleshoot performance issues. (more to come on this later)
