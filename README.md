This is my own resource monitor app I'm using to learn and develop better python skills. I will be deploying it over the course of several weeks to add features and increase what it can do.
I plan to add logging features and a streamlit UI to make it easier to interact with. I hope to use all of these skills I'm learning in my next career path.
