This is my own resource monitor app I'm using to learn and develop better python skills. I will be deploying it over the course of several weeks to add features and increase what it can do.
I did add the streamlit UI to make it easier to interact with. I will be adding more features in the future as i grow or find new things to probe that are under the surface of normal monitors!
